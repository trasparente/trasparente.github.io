Fork this repository and change its name.

Go in repository *Settings* and rename as `yourusername.github.io` which is the new address of your site.

Edit `_config.yml` file:

{% highlight yaml %}
name: trasparente
title: trasparente homepage
description: Can be anything

# CSS THEMES in folder /assets/css/
css: [ 'base.css' ]

# SCRIPTS in folder /assets/js/
script: [ 'jquery-1.10.1.min.js', 'base.js' ]
{% endhighlight %}

`name` and `description` are used for page `title` meta tag (along with specific page title) and in site header.

Here you can add custom `css` and `js` files you need to call across site, place relative files in `assets/css/` and `assets/js/` folders.

Accordingly you can edit the repository description.
