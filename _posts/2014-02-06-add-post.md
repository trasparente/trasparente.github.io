layout: post
title: ADD A POST
category: Docs

Drop a file in *_post* folder

Add a **markdown** file in `_posts/` folder, named by  
`YYYY-MM-DD-file-name.md`  
containing this front-matter:

{% highlight YAML %}
---
layout: post
title: title of the post
category: jazz
tags: [ tag1, tag2 ... ]
---

This is the excerpt

This is the content
...
{% endhighlight %}

### Optional parameters in front-matter

* `class: post-class`  
  Is added as a css-class on your post `<article>` html tag. Use this to custom-style particular posts.
    
* `description: post-description`  
  Used in page meta description, override `site.description`.

### Post as headers

You can use posts just to show an header in desired position using `header` layout. Posts with layout not `post` will be ignored by archive page and search results:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
layout: header
title: we love headers
---
{% endhighlight %}

* optional: if you need a commented header you can add a *markdown* excerpt below front-matter.
